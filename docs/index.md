# Introduction

Created by the [WLCG Security Operations Centers Working Group](https://wlcg-soc-wg.web.cern.ch/), this website will provide the information necessary to decide if you need an SOC, which tools to use, and how to use them. It will save you time as it will contain various recipes, configuration snippets, best practices, and tips and tricks.  

The audience for these documents is anyone interested in deploying SOC capabilities for your site or organisation, as well as anyone interested in cybersecurity interoperability in the research and education communities.

Note that we discuss here the technology deployment work necessary to deploy a minimum viable SOC capability including appropriate discussion of people and processes; in order to operate a production SOC environment, it is critical to also consider the staffing and processes involved in developing and operating the SOC as well as appropriate training and drills.
